CS 174 Project 2

KRAZY PIANO

    - Hierarchical object: Piano, rotating keys are hinged to main body
    
    - Custom objects: Piano, black hole. Both are textured.

    - Discontinuous edges: Edges where sides and bottom face of piano meet. This can be seen more clearly by showing normals (alt+n)
    
    - Viewing normals also makes key movements more obvious
    
    - If MIDI doesn't play, follow the instructions for Firefox at the following link:
        https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/How-to-run-things-locally
        
    - Changing MIDI songs frequently can cause the audio to lag
